    <p>The horse, often known as the domestic horse, is a domesticated one-toed hoofed animal (Equus caballus or Equus ferus caballus). 
      It is one of two extant species in the subgenus Equus, which belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae. Over the last 45 to 55 million 
      years, the horse has evolved from Eohippus, a little multi-toed species, to the big, single-toed animal it is today. Horses were first 
      domesticated by humans in 4000 BC, and their domestication was commonplace by 3000 BC. Horses of the species caballus are domesticated, 
      yet some feral groups of tamed horses exist in the wild.</p>

    <div class="news">
    <p>Horses have evolved to run, allowing them to flee predators swiftly. They also have a good sense of balance and a powerful fight-or-flight 
      response. Horses have an unusual characteristic that allows them to sleep both standing and lying down, with younger horses sleeping substantially 
      more than adults.</p>

    <p>This is related to their need to flee from predators in the wild. Mares, or female horses, carry their young for around 11 months, 
      and a foal, or young horse, may stand and run immediately after birth. Between the ages of two and four, most domesticated horses begin saddle or 
      harness training.</p>

    <p>Energetic "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods," such as draft horses and certain ponies, appropriate for slow, heavy work; and 
      "warmbloods," developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, frequently focusing on establishing breeds for specialized riding uses, 
      particularly in Europe. There are around 300 horse breeds in the world today, designed for a variety of purposes.</p>

    <p>Horses and humans engage in a wide range of sporting events and non-competitive recreational hobbies, as well as in professional settings like 
      law enforcement, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy. Horses have long been employed in warfare, and as a result, a diverse range of riding 
      and driving strategies have evolved, employing a variety of equipment and control systems.</p>
