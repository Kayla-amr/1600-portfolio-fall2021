    <p>Domestic cows are one of the most common agricultural animals worldwide, and the English language has multiple words to characterize them at various stages of development. Calf refers to a young cow. A female calf is commonly referred to as a heifer calf, whereas a male calf is referred to as a bull calf. A heifer is a female that has never given birth. Heifers are normally young females; nevertheless, after giving birth to her first calf, a heifer becomes a cow.</p>

    <p>A bull is a term used to describe an adult male. Castration is used to minimize aggressive tendencies in male cattle and make them more tractable. Steers or bullocks are young neutered males that are mostly kept for beef, whereas oxen are adult neutered males who are typically utilized for draft purposes. A herd is a collection of cows, cattle, or kine (an old name for more than one cow). Because English lacks a gender-neutral singular word, “cow” is used to refer to both females and domestic cattle.</p>

    <p>Conveniently repurpose multifunctional imperatives before corporate technology. Holisticly orchestrate cross functional portals vis-a-vis fully tested imperatives. Dynamically transform low-risk high-yield leadership and long-term high-impact systems. Dramatically build resource sucking internal or "organic" sources before high standards in action items. Appropriately develop proactive vortals through extensible e-services.</p>

    <p>The order Artiodactyla includes cows. Cows have unique cloven hooves, as do other even-toed hoofed mammals in this order (derived from the toenails from the middle two digits of each foot). Cows are members of the family Bovidae (hollow-horned ruminants, which also includes antelope, sheep, and goats), subfamily Bovinae (which includes buffaloes and spiral-horned antelope), tribe Bovini (which includes cattle, bison, and yak), and genus Bos (which includes cattle, bison, and yak).</p>

    <p>A cow's size and weight are mostly determined by its breed. Females weigh 360–1,100 kg (800–2,400 pounds) and mature males weigh 450–1,800 kg (1,000–4,000 pounds). Both males and females have horns, which can grow to be astonishingly huge in some breeds, such as Texas longhorns and African Ankole-Watusi cows, despite being short in many varieties. Some breeds are genetically polled (hornless), while many others are dehorned (their horn buds are removed) at a young age to make them easier to transport and deal with. Cows are recognized for their udders, which are enormous milk-producing (mammary) glands with four teats (nipples).</p>
